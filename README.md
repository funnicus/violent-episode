# Violent Episode

A game, where your character is stuck inside a TV-arena, each room representing a different episode. You must fight in each room against various enemies, that relate to the theme of the room. Can the player survive till the end and gain their freedom back?

**This game is made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)!**

## Git workflow

- Probably a good idea if everyone works on their own branch, and makes pull requests, when they want to add something to the master branch (this way we avoid any stupid conflicts)
